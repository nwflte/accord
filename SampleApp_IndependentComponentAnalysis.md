This sample application shows how to compute and use [Independent Component Analysis (ICA)](http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_Statistics_Analysis_IndependentComponentAnalysis.htm) to perform blind source separation of two mixed sound signals. By default, the application comes with two mixed audio recordings from a sample CNN broadcast.
